#### Project History

- Originally created by [@charlesbel](https://github.com/charlesbel) as [Microsoft-Rewards-Farmer](https://github.com/charlesbel/Microsoft-Rewards-Farmer).
- Forked and significantly refactored/maintained by [@klept0](https://github.com/klept0) as [MS-Rewards-Farmer](https://github.com/klept0/MS-Rewards-Farmer), with contributions from a community of volunteers.
- The [@klept0](https://github.com/klept0) fork was **archived in January 2026**. This repository continues the project with the goal of cleaning up the codebase and expanding its functionality.

#### PULL REQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND APPRECIATED!

## Installation

[//]: # (todo - add Docker installation instructions)

1. Create a virtual environment using `venv`:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:

   * On Windows:

   ```sh
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   * On macOS/Linux:

   ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install requirements with the following command :
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or, if developing or running tests, install the dev requirements with:
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

   Upgrade all required with the following command:
   `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

4. Make sure you have Chrome installed

5. (Windows Only) Make sure Visual C++ redistributable DLLs are installed

   If they're not, install the current "vc_redist.exe" from
   this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
   and reboot your computer

6. Run the script with the following arguments:
   ```sh
   python main.py -C
   ```

7. Open the generated `config.yaml` file and edit it with your information.

   The "totp" field is not mandatory, only enter your TOTP key if you use it for 2FA (if
   ommitting, don't keep it as an empty string, remove the line completely).

   The "proxy" field is not mandatory, you can omit it if you don't want to use proxy (don't
   keep it as an empty string, remove the line completely).

   You can add or remove accounts according to your will.

   the "apprise.urls" field is not mandatory, you can remove it if you don't want to get notifications.

8. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

   (Windows Only) You can also run the script wrapper that will detect your python installation
   and re-run the script if it crashes using `.\run.ps1` (`.\run.ps1 -help` for more
   information). To allow script execution without confirmation, use the following command:
   `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`.

9. (Windows Only) You can set up automatic execution by generating a Task Scheduler XML file.

   If you are a Windows user, run the `generate_task_xml.py` script to create a `.xml` file.
   After generating the file, import it into Task Scheduler to schedule automatic execution of
   the script. This will allow the script to run at the specified time without manual
   intervention.

   To import the XML file into Task Scheduler,
   see [this guide](https://superuser.com/a/485565/709704).

## Configuration file

All the variable listed here can be added to you `config.yaml` configuration file, and the values represented here show
the default ones, if not said otherwise.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please don't use this as your configuration. It's an example to show configuration possibilities,
> not the best configuration for you. Doing so will only prevent default values from being used,
> and it'll result in preventing updates (such as ignored activities).
> You should only add a variable to your configuration file if you want to change it.
